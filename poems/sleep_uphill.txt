<poem>
you sleep uphill
I
scared, the light switches glow 
in the darkness above your head; 
the air is high summer, opiated, 
rainstorm, thunder, humid damp;
you are uncomfortable and
one leg refuses to function and
strange pains appear in new parts 
of your old and tired body.  <p>
II
at night the giant moths fling
themselves against the
caravan windows, drawn
by a solo, solar light;
you read and you wriggle
you toss and you turn. <p>
III
by day you wear bright 
red earphones and laugh.
you handle three digital
devices simultaneously;
you click and you point, 
you click and you point,
at times pleased, 
at times pouting,
at times mostly hidden.
