<poem>
the smell is so familiar of oil and 
burning metals and
I am in an engineering workshop
with merlin fixing his landrover
gear stick swivel ball locator pin,
where the machines sit squat, solid, metallic,
green, they carry the names of english
engineering equipment manufacturers from
manchester, sheffield, bradford, wigan, leeds,
they sit in serried rows, quiet for now 
but with an unexplored kinetic menace. <p>
I remember how easily they would
cut crush nick mangle maim innocent digits and 
flail raw skin raw, they would pinch, burn, 
bruise, tear at my father daily. <P>
each and every item of equipment is designed 
to mould or transform metal in some way,
to bend twist pound press
drill cut thread crease
cast bolt rent and join <p>
but there on the floor
cast down into the oil
ingrained by various
spills and accidents
decades old, are the
spiralled shavings swarfs
thinned down into small
representations of reverses and
opposites and 
negatives <p>
in a parallel universe they mimic
and complete the twisted threads
of bolts and studs,
the grindings of countless
rusty sheets and plates
the misplaced welds and
burning molten metal droplets
