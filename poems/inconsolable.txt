<poem>
It has been a great day, full
of achievement and love, things
getting done - everything working out fine. <p>
You shop for food, buy second hand windows, 
a door, some seeds, nails, a tape measure, 
a new element for the stove. <p>
The kids have a ball. You buy them fish
and chips for lunch, an endless supply
of lollies, potato chips, milk shakes all 
afternoon. They play happily in the park,
you push them on the swings, help the little 
one up and down on the jungle gym,
let them jump all over you for ages.<P>
The car drives wonderfully, like a greased pig. 
It uses a lot of gas but you dont mind because 
there is no sign of the radiator overheating 
on the hills. You fly.
As dusk falls you head home.
A full moon pops up over a hill around a corner. 
there is little traffic. The surf on the shore is 
hypnotic, its a warm spring night and the car smells 
of salt air and vinegar and orange peel.
You stop at a deserted beach and quickly collect a 
heap of dry driftwood. You light a fire, fry sausages 
and eggs, smother them in tomato sauce, slap them 
between slices of white bread. They taste the best.
You hold hands happy, stupidly invincible. <p>
Later, you are back in the car driving,
the kids stretch out, you sing song after song 
in beautiful harmony, they quietly fall asleep.
You take little sips of fine whiskey,
smoke a small pipe of good dak. <p>
up the road you pull over next to a 
flowering pohutukawa tree and 
there your mate takes a mimi in the shadow of the moon.
