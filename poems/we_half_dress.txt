<poem>
My camo clothing fits me in shapeless splendour,
I wear oversize to disguise my figure,
to hide, to bulk up, to cover my 
peacock colours and to sadly drab down and <p>
my patterns are made for the far-away conflicts, 
fought in foreign inhospitable regions by 
foreign military and corporate masters and <p>
I blend into the deserts of Kuwait or Iraq or 
Afghanistan, I blend into the jungles of Vietnam and 
Colombia, I blend into the frozen wastes of the 
arctic. My green NATO jacket, fur-hooded,
is ubiquitous in this urban environment and <p>
I am already half-dressed for war,
casting about for the most appropriate 
places to fit in and <p>
I am already half-dressed for war, thanks, 
half-dressed for conflict, ready to compete and 
do battle and we are legions, big data 
subsets and slivers of socio-economic tax brackets 
and <P>
we present as an army of misfits, 
untrained and rag-taggle, memorable for 
our ability to just disappear, to 
move like fish in the oceans and seas, 
invisible from certain angles, 
schooling for protective and 
collective security.
