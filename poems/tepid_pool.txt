<poem>
#11
There is a sterility of environment 
present here, a cleaness to the air, 
clinical, not much humour, 
this is serious work, the pursuit of 
health and happiness. <p>
#27
she rests at the end of the pool
she appears small and diminutive
she is in therapy and this place is a 
part of it. for the moment she glides 
effortlessly, easily through the 
water, the sum total of her problems 
are to get from one side of the pool to the 
nother, which is how it should be.<p>
#34
the chinese women in the spa pool watch
me wiith open-mouthed disbelief for
it is written that one day, a barefoot man,
unshaven, will turn up at the pool. <p>
He will move a bench seat up against a wall - 
he will look but not speak. 
In time he will make eye contact with 
every individual and then leave
without anyone noticing his departure.
