<poem>
I hope Iâ€™ll be able to hear the sounds of
the arguing, loud, late at night.
<p>
I hope the sound of the smashing
crockery is plainly audible.
<p>
I hope you save your best emotional scenes
for the still of the middle of the evening,
when the noise of the constant fights will
travel best across the road to me and
<p>
then go up the misty river valleys,
where they will scare the native birds
into noisy flight, scatter the cattle and
<p>
induce terrible nightmares into the
peaceful sleep of small children.
<p>
Can you do that for me please?<p>
Conduct all of your fight sequences
when atmospheric conditions are best
suited for listening and recording.
<p>
Cheers.
