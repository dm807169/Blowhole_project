<poem>
Lord,
may my outlook express addressbook never be
subject to a visual basic script and Then spam 
three thousand others with malignancy
and <p>
lord
may THE malware and spyware from distant balkan
states never keylog capture and spit my banking
details to the Triads of Hong Kong
and <p>
lord
may I never receive zillions of weird and curious
emails extorting me to increase my breast or
penis size or transfer funds to bogus nigerians
and <p>
lord
may i never click on an unknown jpeg attachment
and end up in the land of beastial pornography
and <p>
lord
may my virus software never allow my registry
files to become corrupted, snafu and then
completely destroy my partition table
and  <P>
lord
may the direct marketing, customer loyalty
programmes, data mining companies and/or the organs 
of the state never capture my entire personal, web 
and financial history, burn them to DVD along with 
2 million other new zealanders and then leave them 
behind on a Wellington bus
and <p>
lord
may my bit torrents never loose their encryption
algorithms and render them naked and visible to
the project echelon dishes at waihopi and tangimoana.
