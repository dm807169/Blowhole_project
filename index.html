    <h3>Speed of Sound</h3>
    <pre>I hope I'll be able to hear the sounds of
the arguing, loud, late at night.
I hope the sound of the smashing
crockery is plainly audible.
      
I hope you save your best emotional scenes
for the still of the middle of the evening,
when the noise of the constant fights will
travel best across the road to me and
      
then go up the misty river valleys,
where they will scare the native birds
into noisy flight, scatter the cattle and
induce terrible nightmares into the
peaceful sleep of small children.
      
Can you do that for me please?
      
Conduct all of your fight sequences
when atmospheric conditions are best
suited for listening and recording.
Cheers.</pre>

  <h3>machine shop</h3>
  <pre>the smell is so familiar of oil and 
burning metals and
I am in an engineering workshop
with merlin fixing his landrover
gear stick swivel ball locator pin,
where the machines sit squat, solid, metallic,
green, they carry the names of english
engineering equipment manufacturers from
manchester, sheffield, bradford, wigan, leeds,
they sit in serried rows, quiet for now 
but with an unexplored kinetic menace. <p>
I remember how easily they would
cut crush nick mangle maim innocent digits and 
flail raw skin raw, they would pinch, burn, 
bruise, tear at my father daily. <P>
each and every item of equipment is designed 
to mould or transform metal in some way,
to bend twist pound press
drill cut thread crease
cast bolt rent and join <p>
but there on the floor
cast down into the oil
ingrained by various
spills and accidents
decades old, are the
spiralled shavings swarfs
thinned down into small
representations of reverses and
opposites and 
negatives <p>
in a parallel universe they mimic
and complete the twisted threads
of bolts and studs,
the grindings of countless
rusty sheets and plates
the misplaced welds and
burning molten metal droplets</pre>

  <h3>we half dress for war</h3>
  <pre>My camo clothing fits me in shapeless splendour,
I wear oversize to disguise my figure,
to hide, to bulk up, to cover my 
peacock colours and to sadly drab down and 
my patterns are made for the far-away conflicts, 
fought in foreign inhospitable regions by 
foreign military and corporate masters and 
I blend into the deserts of Kuwait or Iraq or 
Afghanistan, I blend into the jungles of Vietnam and 
Colombia, I blend into the frozen wastes of the 
arctic. My green NATO jacket, fur-hooded,
is ubiquitous in this urban environment and <p>
I am already half-dressed for war,
casting about for the most appropriate 
places to fit in and 
I am already half-dressed for war, thanks, 
half-dressed for conflict, ready to compete and 
do battle and we are legions, big data 
subsets and slivers of socio-economic tax brackets 
and 
we present as an army of misfits, 
untrained and rag-taggle, memorable for 
our ability to just disappear, to 
move like fish in the oceans and seas, 
invisible from certain angles, 
schooling for protective and 
collective security.</pre>

    <h3>good stuff</h3>
  <pre>
I
singing along to music with mates; 
a feed with a family.
II
some chooks, a vegetable garden and some laden 
fruit trees; a simple small shack called home, with 
sunshine heat; an unexplored new second-hand 
shop, bursting; floating in a waterhole watching a 
tame eel, gliding; a goat run, a house cow.
III
a working compost heap and a worm farm; 
ripening tomatoes, nicely staked; a long dry 
summer and some full water tanks, the sight 
of a newborn baby, a favourite cafe.
IV
a grey water system and some solar power panels; 
sprouts on a window sill, germinating in warmth; 
a cat in a lap and an old dog curled at your feet, 
content with a full belly; the sounds of frogs in a 
nearby pond, the distant echo of a train, carried 
by wistful winds across a landscape of silence.
V 
the smell of home baking on a coalrange and 
butter on fresh popcorn; a tank full of gas and 
infinite possibilities, stretching; a big stack of 
dry, seasoned wood split ready for fireplace 
crackle; a favourite pen and pencil, a steaming 
mug of sweet cocoa or hot chocolate made 
from real organic milk.
VI
a cheerful tune whistled in a hallway; 
a kite climbing strongly upwards in fresh 
winds; the gentle brush of loversâ€™ lips and a 
soft fingertip caress in the dark as hands meet, 
independently during intimacies.
VII
a blue aerogramme, densely packed with small, 
tight, cursive writing, conveying feelings of love 
and longing; a big woollen hat and scarf and a 
comfortable, warm coat in winter frosts; fresh 
bread and fresh flowers on a ramshackle,
old and cluttered, kitchen table.

  <h3>sad rocks</h3>
  <pre>I miss you, 
you should know this, 
over a distance which 
kills me slowly like river water 
running over sad rocks. 
So I am now better off maintaining 
an attitude like an ember, 
barely alight but 
cosy with residual, 
stored affection.
I will be ready to burst into a 
bright, small, warm flame, 
eventually, again, 
just not with you, 
anytime, 
ever.</pre>

  <h3>Tepid Pool</h3>
  <pre>#11
There is a sterility of environment 
present here, a cleaness to the air, 
clinical, not much humour, 
this is serious work, the pursuit of 
health and happiness. <p>
#27
she rests at the end of the pool
she appears small and diminutive
she is in therapy and this place is a 
part of it. for the moment she glides 
effortlessly, easily through the 
water, the sum total of her problems 
are to get from one side of the pool to the 
nother, which is how it should be.<p>
#34
the chinese women in the spa pool watch
me wiith open-mouthed disbelief for
it is written that one day, a barefoot man,
unshaven, will turn up at the pool. <p>
He will move a bench seat up against a wall - 
he will look but not speak. 
In time he will make eye contact with 
every individual and then leave
without anyone noticing his departure.</pre>

  <h3>geek prayer 22</h3>
  <pre>Lord,
may my outlook express addressbook never be
subject to a visual basic script and Then spam 
three thousand others with malignancy
and 
lord
may THE malware and spyware from distant balkan
states never keylog capture and spit my banking
details to the Triads of Hong Kong
and 
lord
may I never receive zillions of weird and curious
emails extorting me to increase my breast or
penis size or transfer funds to bogus nigerians
and 
lord
may i never click on an unknown jpeg attachment
and end up in the land of beastial pornography
and
lord
may my virus software never allow my registry
files to become corrupted, snafu and then
completely destroy my partition table
and  
lord
may the direct marketing, customer loyalty
programmes, data mining companies and/or the organs 
of the state never capture my entire personal, web 
and financial history, burn them to DVD along with 
2 million other new zealanders and then leave them 
behind on a Wellington bus
and 
lord
may my bit torrents never loose their encryption
algorithms and render them naked and visible to
the project echelon dishes at waihopi and tangimoana.</pre>

  <h3>you sleep uphill</h3>
  <pre>
I
scared, the light switches glow 
in the darkness above your head; 
the air is high summer, opiated, 
rainstorm, thunder, humid damp;
you are uncomfortable and
one leg refuses to function and
strange pains appear in new parts 
of your old and tired body. 
II
at night the giant moths fling
themselves against the
caravan windows, drawn
by a solo, solar light;
you read and you wriggle
you toss and you turn. 
III
by day you wear bright 
red earphones and laugh.
you handle three digital
devices simultaneously;
you click and you point, 
you click and you point,
at times pleased, 
at times pouting,
at times mostly hidden.</pre>

  <h3>inconsolable</h3>
  <pre>
It has been a great day, full
of achievement and love, things
getting done - everything working out fine. <p>
You shop for food, buy second hand windows, 
a door, some seeds, nails, a tape measure, 
a new element for the stove. <p>
The kids have a ball. You buy them fish
and chips for lunch, an endless supply
of lollies, potato chips, milk shakes all 
afternoon. They play happily in the park,
you push them on the swings, help the little 
one up and down on the jungle gym,
let them jump all over you for ages.<P>
The car drives wonderfully, like a greased pig. 
It uses a lot of gas but you dont mind because 
there is no sign of the radiator overheating 
on the hills. You fly. <p>
As dusk falls you head home.
A full moon pops up over a hill around a corner. 
there is little traffic. The surf on the shore is 
hypnotic, its a warm spring night and the car smells 
of salt air and vinegar and orange peel. <p>
You stop at a deserted beach and quickly collect a 
heap of dry driftwood. You light a small fire, fry sausages 
and eggs, smother them in tomato sauce, slap them 
between slices of white bread. They taste the best.
You hold hands happy, stupidly invincible. <p>
Later, you are back in the car driving,
the kids stretch out, you sing song after song 
in beautiful harmony, they quietly fall asleep.
You take little sips of fine whiskey,
smoke a small pipe of good dak. <p>
up the road you pull over next to a 
flowering pohutukawa tree and 
there your mate takes a mimi in the shadow of the moon.</pre>
