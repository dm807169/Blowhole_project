    <h3>Speed of Sound</h3>
    <pre>I hope I'll be able to hear the sounds of
the arguing, loud, late at night.
I hope the sound of the smashing
crockery is plainly audible.
      
I hope you save your best emotional scenes
for the still of the middle of the evening,
when the noise of the constant fights will
travel best across the road to me and
      
then go up the misty river valleys,
where they will scare the native birds
into noisy flight, scatter the cattle and
induce terrible nightmares into the
peaceful sleep of small children.
      
Can you do that for me please?
      
Conduct all of your fight sequences
when atmospheric conditions are best
suited for listening and recording.
Cheers.</pre>

  <h3>we half dress for war</h3>
  <pre>My camo clothing fits me in shapeless splendour,
I wear oversize to disguise my figure,
to hide, to bulk up, to cover my 
peacock colours and to sadly drab down and 
my patterns are made for the far-away conflicts, 
fought in foreign inhospitable regions by 
foreign military and corporate masters and 
I blend into the deserts of Kuwait or Iraq or 
Afghanistan, I blend into the jungles of Vietnam and 
Colombia, I blend into the frozen wastes of the 
arctic. My green NATO jacket, fur-hooded,
is ubiquitous in this urban environment and <p>
I am already half-dressed for war,
casting about for the most appropriate 
places to fit in and 
I am already half-dressed for war, thanks, 
half-dressed for conflict, ready to compete and 
do battle and we are legions, big data 
subsets and slivers of socio-economic tax brackets 
and 
we present as an army of misfits, 
untrained and rag-taggle, memorable for 
our ability to just disappear, to 
move like fish in the oceans and seas, 
invisible from certain angles, 
schooling for protective and 
collective security.</pre>

  <h3>geek prayer 22</h3>
  <pre>Lord,
may my outlook express addressbook never be
subject to a visual basic script and Then spam 
three thousand others with malignancy
and 
lord
may THE malware and spyware from distant balkan
states never keylog capture and spit my banking
details to the Triads of Hong Kong
and 
lord
may I never receive zillions of weird and curious
emails extorting me to increase my breast or
penis size or transfer funds to bogus nigerians
and 
lord
may i never click on an unknown jpeg attachment
and end up in the land of beastial pornography
and
lord
may my virus software never allow my registry
files to become corrupted, snafu and then
completely destroy my partition table
and  
lord
may the direct marketing, customer loyalty
programmes, data mining companies and/or the organs 
of the state never capture my entire personal, web 
and financial history, burn them to DVD along with 
2 million other new zealanders and then leave them 
behind on a Wellington bus
and 
lord
may my bit torrents never loose their encryption
algorithms and render them naked and visible to
the project echelon dishes at waihopi and tangimoana.</pre>

  <h3>you sleep uphill</h3>
  <pre>
I
scared, the light switches glow 
in the darkness above your head; 
the air is high summer, opiated, 
rainstorm, thunder, humid damp;
you are uncomfortable and
one leg refuses to function and
strange pains appear in new parts 
of your old and tired body. 
II
at night the giant moths fling
themselves against the
caravan windows, drawn
by a solo, solar light;
you read and you wriggle
you toss and you turn. 
III
by day you wear bright 
red earphones and laugh.
you handle three digital
devices simultaneously;
you click and you point, 
you click and you point,
at times pleased, 
at times pouting,
at times mostly hidden.</pre>

  <h3>inconsolable</h3>
  <pre>
It has been a great day, full
of achievement and love, things
getting done - everything working out fine. <p>
You shop for food, buy second hand windows, 
a door, some seeds, nails, a tape measure, 
a new element for the stove. <p>
The kids have a ball. You buy them fish
and chips for lunch, an endless supply
of lollies, potato chips, milk shakes all 
afternoon. They play happily in the park,
you push them on the swings, help the little 
one up and down on the jungle gym,
let them jump all over you for ages.<P>
The car drives wonderfully, like a greased pig. 
It uses a lot of gas but you dont mind because 
there is no sign of the radiator overheating 
on the hills. You fly. <p>
As dusk falls you head home.
A full moon pops up over a hill around a corner. 
there is little traffic. The surf on the shore is 
hypnotic, its a warm spring night and the car smells 
of salt air and vinegar and orange peel. <p>
You stop at a deserted beach and quickly collect a 
heap of dry driftwood. You light a small fire, fry sausages 
and eggs, smother them in tomato sauce, slap them 
between slices of white bread. They taste the best.
You hold hands happy, stupidly invincible. <p>
Later, you are back in the car driving,
the kids stretch out, you sing song after song 
in beautiful harmony, they quietly fall asleep.
You take little sips of fine whiskey,
smoke a small pipe of good dak. <p>
up the road you pull over next to a 
flowering pohutukawa tree and 
there your mate takes a mimi in the shadow of the moon.</pre>
